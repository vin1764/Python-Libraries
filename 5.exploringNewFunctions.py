#To know what all functions are available for a data type, we can use the dir function. For eg,
#if we want to know what all functiona can we perform on a string, we can use:

print(dir(str)) #this will print the names of all available functions for string

print(help(str)) #this will print the names as well as the functions of all functions 
                 #available for string

print(help(str.lower))  #this will print the function of the lower function of strings
